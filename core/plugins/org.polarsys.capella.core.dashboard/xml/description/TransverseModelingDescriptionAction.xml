<form>
    <p><b>Describe the state machine of the system</b>, specifying which are its modes and states. Among others, state machines can be created on the following kinds of elements: system, components, actors, classes (data), etc.</p>
    <p><b>Describe the domain elements and the actually exchanged data.</b></p>
    <li>Domain Elements: modeling elements of the domain should not be "polluted" by technical considerations (e.g.: internal representation of data, database storage, access methods, etc.). In the beginning, concentrate only on elements that provide high-level semantic related to the domain.</li>
    <li>Data actually exchanged between components: used for example to type parameters in interface operations. These data have to be unambiguous and consistent.</li>
    <p>Both the domain elements and actual data are described in a Class diagram.</p>
