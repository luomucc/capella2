# Error Messages
#

genericToolError = An error occurs during internal merge tool use.
genericInternalError = An internal Error occurs during the merge process (class {0}).
unableToCreateMergeLinkDueToNullElt = Unable to create a MergeLink between 2 elements as one is null.
executionEndAESettingfailed = Merge error during the update of ExecutionEnd range.
strandReplacement = The merge process can not connect some elements of decomposed scenario to the merged ones.
mergeErrorTopMessage = An error occurs during the merge process of the Scenario {0} on the capability realization {1}. {2}
canNotPerformLevel = Merge process error: Can not perform replacement of the following InstanceRoles: ''{0}'' with data from the refined scenario {1}.
unhandledIFrag = Merge process error: InteractionFragment of type {0} are not supported yet.
interactionUseFeatureNotSupported = The merger does not support InteractionUse yet.

cannotPerformAFullMerge = The merge step during refinement has not been totally done due to lack of data (may be the refinement has not been fully done.)
objectRemovedDueToLackOfData = the {0} ''{1}'' can not be merged.

# Merge processor

mergeProcessorName = Scenario Merge Processor   
genericError = Merge of the scenario {0} contained into the capability realization {1} failed.
preValidationErr = Error during pre-validation of the scenario {0} contained into the capability realization {1}. Merge process and thus, refinement one to Physical layer can not be performed. Please check validity of your model.
postValidationErr = The merge result of the scenario {0} contained into the capability realization {1} is not compliant with Capella Rules.  Merge process and thus, refinement one to Physical layer can not be performed.

preValidationRaiseErrors = The merge pre-validation step raises some errors.
preValidationRaiseWarnings = The merge pre-validation step raises some warnings.
preValidationRaiseInfos = The merge pre-validation step raises some infos.
