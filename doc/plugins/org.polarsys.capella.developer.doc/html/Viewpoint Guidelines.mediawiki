= Viewpoint Guidelines =

To avoid performance issues, some guidelines must be followed.

== Diagram extensions ==

=== Expressions in .odesigns ===
For performance reasons, when writing expressions in .odesigns it is recommended to:
<ul>
<li>Use Java services,</li>
<li>Use AQL expressions,</li>
<li>Not use Acceleo 2 expressions (Acceleo 2 is deprecated).</li>
</ul> 

=== Semantic Candidate Expression ===
This expression called at each diagram refresh should be the most efficient possible. It can be computed based on the displayed graphical elements using the variable *diagram*. When 'Import Mapping' are used, please ensure that semantic candidate expression has been updated accordingly to the semantic candidate expression of the imported mapping

=== Create Generic Viewpoints ===
Create Generic Viewpoints using:
* Sirius capability to extends several diagrams at one time with regular expressions extensions 
* Diagram Styles Customization Feature allowing to customize the style of elements based on expression. (for instance, on all "Functions called 'Deprecated'", set color as gray)

== Avoid EObject.eResource calls ==

On EObject, you have to avoid as much as possible calls to eObject.eResource()


== Contribute an ID handler ==

If your metamodel elements doesn't inherit from org.polarsys.capella.common.data.modellingcore.ModelElement, you have to contribute an Id handler via the extension point "org.polarsys.capella.shared.id.handler.IdHandler"
You can simply extend the org.polarsys.capella.shared.id.handler.AbstractIdHandler.
