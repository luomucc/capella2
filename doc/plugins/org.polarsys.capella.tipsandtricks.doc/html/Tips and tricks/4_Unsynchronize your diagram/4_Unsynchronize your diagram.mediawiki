=Unsynchronize Your Diagram=

This functionality allows to master complexity and avoids hiding a lot of diagram elements which decreases the performance. For more information, please refer to the section ''Capella Guide > User Manual > Diagram Management > Advanced Management of Diagrams > Synchronized and Unsynchronized Diagrams''.

You should unsynchronize a diagram to:
* keep a diagram display unchanged even if additional elements (ports, sub components ...) are added in the model, for documentary purpose for instance.
* control the elements displayed without hiding unwanted ones.
