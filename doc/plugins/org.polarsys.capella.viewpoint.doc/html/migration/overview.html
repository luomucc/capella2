<h2>Overview</h2>
<br/>
There is two scenarios for migration:
<ol>
	<li>
<b>New Capella version</b><br/>
When a new version of Capella is available, the viewpoint data may need to be migrated.
	</li>
	<li>
<b>New viewpoint version</b><br/>
Within the current version of Capella is available, the viewpoint can be updated to a new version. In this case the viewpoint data may need to be migrated.data may need to be migrated.
	</li>
</ol>

Version numbers follow the usual eclipse convention: major.minor.micro.qualifier For example: 1.1.0.20161004114119
When a viewpoint is updated in the platform, if its version major or minor number is upgraded the existing models will need a migration. 

<br/>
<br/>
The migration is orchestrated by Capella in both cases.
