Using the contextual menu on this multiple selection, click on Functional Chain / Create a Functional Chain

 
A new Functional Chain is created and displayed.

If you want to edit a Functional Chain, you have to create a Functional Chain Description diagram. You can create this diagram from a Navigate command in the contextual menu from a Functional Chain.

 
A new diagram is created, representing your Functional Chain. What you see on this diagram are not Functions and Exchanges but Functional Chain Involvement elements. This is a essentially a &quot;working&quot; diagram.

On the following diagram, the tools of the palette have been used to include a new Function and new Exchanges so that we have a branch.

 
* The &ldquo;Involve Function&rdquo; tool simply adds a new element 	representing a Function. It is the responsibility of the user to add 	the necessary Functional Exchanges in order to form a complete 	Functional Chain.
* The &ldquo;Involve Functional Exchange&rdquo; allows selecting a 	possible (already existing) Exchange between the selected source and 	target elements representing Functions.
* The &ldquo;Involve Functional Chain&rdquo; tool adds a new element 	representing a Functional Chain. It is the responsibility of the 	user to add the necessary Functional Exchanges in order to form a 	complete Functional Chain.
* The &ldquo;Involve Functional Exchange and Target Function&rdquo; is 	contextual to the selected source Function element: it allows 	creating at the same time both the elements representing an outgoing 	Exchange and the Target Function.
* The &ldquo;Involve Functional Exchange and Target Functional Chain&rdquo; 	is contextual to the selected source Function element: it allows 	creating at the same time both the elements representing an outgoing 	Exchange and the Target Functional Chain.

On the dataflow diagram, the result is the following.

== Physical Paths ==
 
The same strategy applies for Physical Paths on System Architecture Blank and Logical Architecture Blank and Physical Architecture Blank diagrams.
