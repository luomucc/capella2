This command is available both from the Project Explorer and the Diagrams.</p><p>One of the main advantage of this contextual allocation dialog is that is allows selecting several Functions / Activities at once and allocate them to the selected element.</p><p><img height="518" width="420" border="0" src="Images/7.2.%20Contextual%20Allocations_html_3fa439ce.png"/></p><p>The possible choices are then proposed.</p><p><img height="512" width="385" border="0" src="Images/7.2.%20Contextual%20Allocations_html_m481776f5.png"/></p><p><br/>
