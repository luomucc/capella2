Capella offers migration feature to operate with old Capella projects.

 
To launch the migration process on a Capella Project, right click on the <u>'''project'''</u> and choose ''migration &gt; Migrate Project toward current version''

A reminder asks to manually make a versioned copy (baseline) of the model before running migration.

 
Capella creates backup files before performing migration to go back in case of migration problems, even if models are not managed in source control. Please check the option &ldquo;Backup models before the migration&rdquo;.

Some additional migration commands are available on semantic and diagram files allowing advanced migration processes by triggering migration on each files kind separately. These commands can be enabled following "Capella Guide > User Manual > Preferences > Capella > Commands & User Profiles" section.

At the end of the migration of a project, we recommend to run a manual global refresh of all diagrams on the migrated project (See Capella Guide > User Manual > Diagram Management > Diagram Concepts > Diagram Refreshing Strategies).
